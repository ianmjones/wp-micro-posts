# Micro Posts

Adds a "Micro" post type for Indie Microblogging with WordPress. Features a minimalist editing experience which focuses on content and comments. Titles are generated from the content and Permalinks are based on publishing timestamps.

Inspired by the upcoming book "Indie Microblogging: owning your short-form writing" and the related project http://micro.blog, by Manton Reece.

## Planned Features

- 3rd Party integrations with social network platforms for re-posting.
